# Elulands

Elulands is a free, modern, and truly player-driven MMORPG game that integrates a true economic system powered by the Binance Smart Chain.

It is a world in which players control the world through land ownership, and where resources are tokenized as valuable non-fungible trading crypto collectibles, which are acquired by playing objectives rather than through loot boxes or cash shops.

Players can trade, sell or buy resources in Elulands for Elunium Tokens, and those who invest in LAND to become landowners evolve the world by placing NPCs and accessible buildings, etc., and can turn a profit by creating and selling in-game things like vendor marketplaces where other players can buy in-game purchases such as goods, services, and more.

In other words, instead of closing down the in-game economy, we are opening it by letting players do what they wish with the resources they truly own.

Through Elulands, we engage the users and community to help develop a significant, persistent game world where the community permanently owns and determines the influence of the setting.

It is a vacuum for those who canâ€™t see beyond their goals or build the land, game, and object economy.

The multilevel, open-world gameplay that's part of Elulands is more than the sum of its parts. It's your world, a community, an economy.
